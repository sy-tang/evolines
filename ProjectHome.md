## Software Evolution Storylines ##

From the [original project page](http://www.michaelogawa.com/research/storylines/):

Data comes from the project repository logs. Time flows horizontally from left to right. At each timestep (usually a month) developers are clustered by the files they modify. A histogram at the bottom shows the volume and type of file committed. You can mouse-over individual lines to see them better.
